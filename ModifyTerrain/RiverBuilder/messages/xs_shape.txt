STRING (STRING = AU, SU or TZ) -  The shape of the cross section on the Y-Z plane. Input must be AU, SU, or TZ(n), where n is the number of edges that defines the length of the trapezoidal base such that 0 < n < (Y-Z Increments). It is recommended that unless you really know what you are doing with AU or are starting from a good AU template file, then only use SU or TZ.\n\nIf AU is selected, specify a Centerline Curvature.\n\n\If TZ is selected, specify n:\n -  Triangle: n = 0\n - Trapezoid: 1 <= n <= (Y-Z Increments-2)\n - Rectangle: (Y-Z Increments-3) <= n <= (Y-Z Increments)
