Bankfull Width (USER FUNCTION) - governs the downstream variability in the distance between bank tops on the X-Y plane. If you create an undulating function, be very careful that the banks do not literally cross over to create negative channel widths. We have implemented a minimum bankfull width variable to help avoid this, but it is wise to reason out the amplitude of your width function and not have to rely on that safety net. For longer river segments, try a linear function that increases width in the downstream direction, consistent with geomorphic theory. You can find parameters for the downstream width increase in the geomorphic literature quite easily.
