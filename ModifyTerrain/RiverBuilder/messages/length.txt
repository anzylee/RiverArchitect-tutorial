Length (FLOAT) - the length of the x-axis of the river valley. This is only the channel length if the river is straight. If the river is sinuous, then this length is the valley length and the actual channel length will depend on the sinuosity. Sinuosity is computed by the model and reported in the Data.csv file, so you can compute the final channel length if you want to know it.
