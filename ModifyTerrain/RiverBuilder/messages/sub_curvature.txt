Centerline Curvature (USER FUNCTION) - Normally the sub-reach variability functions for centerline curvature would be set equal to those governing the meandering centerline. However, one application of the curvature value is with controlling the asymmetry of a channel's cross-sectional shape. To provide greater flexibility with how a river's XS shape changes along the river, we have created a decoupled centerline curvature variable. This variable has no effect on the channels meandering. It only affects how channel asymmetry varies down the river. For example, let's say that you did not want the deepest part of the cross-section to be at the outer bend of a meander, then you could use this to put the deepest part anywhere you want governed by the available variability functions. This is a highly complex tool to control compared to others, so only use it if you really know what you are doing with your river design concept.
