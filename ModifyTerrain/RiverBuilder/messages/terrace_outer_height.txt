Outer Terrace Edge Height (in meters, i.e., FLOAT >= 0.0) - the incremental increase in elevation from the outer edge of the floodplain to the outer edge of the terrace on the Y-Z plane. If this number is close to zero, then the terrace is essentially flat. If it is high, then the terrace is sloped.
