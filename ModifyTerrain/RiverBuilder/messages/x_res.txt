X Resolution (FLOAT > 0.0, e.g., 1=1-m resolution) - the resolution of equally spaced data points spaced along the X-axis in units of meters. There is no limit to how fine the point spacing can be, other than computation time for your computer. The smaller this number, the longer the code will take to run. Use your judgement to decide how much detail you need given the scale of your river and the resolution of the sub-reach variability functions you are applying. There is no need for extra detail if the river is easily interpolated with less data.
