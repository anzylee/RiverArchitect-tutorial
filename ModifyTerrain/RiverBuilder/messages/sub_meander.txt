Meandering Centerline (USER FUNCTION) - governs the shape of the riverâ€™s tortuous flow path (i.e., meandering or sinuosity) on the X-Y plane. At this time, it is not possible to make gooseneck loops, but the available functions offer a good range of flexibility to mimic diverse sinuosity values. If you do not care about the details of the pattern, but only want to match a sinuosity value, then it is recommended that you use the Perlin function and iteratively adjust the parameters until the sinuosity value in the Data.csv output file matches your target value.
