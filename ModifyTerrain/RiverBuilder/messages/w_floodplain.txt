Floodplain Width (in meters, i.e., FLOAT >= 0.0) -  double the horizontal distance from the bank top on one side of the river to the outer edge of the floodplain on the same side of the river. Note that if the floodplain has a lateral slope, then this value is still just the horizontal distance, not the slope distance on the floodplain surface. This value is the sum of horizontal floodplain distances for both sizes of the river, so keep that in mind when designing your floodplain. If this number is zero, then there is no floodplain, which yields a confined valley/canyon scenario. If it is a big number, then there is a very wide floodplain. This applies symmetrically to both sides of the river. If you want asymmetric floodplains, then that is handled with independent Left/Right Floodplain sub-reach variability functions.
