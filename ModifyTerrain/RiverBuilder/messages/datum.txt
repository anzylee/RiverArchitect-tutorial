Datum (FLOAT) - a fixed starting point of operation to measure changes of a specific property. Used for thalweg elevation. This datum is located at the downstream end of the synthetic river valley, and then the river goes up from there. Thus, if the datum is set as any number >0, then it is guaranteed that all elevations in the valley will also be > 0. You may set any arbitrary number you wish. If you want to estimate the total elevation range of the thalweg along the river, then simply multiply your Valley Slope input by the Length input and that will give you the overall elevation range of the thalweg. For example, for a 1000 m long channel and a Valley slope of 0.01, then thalweg elevation range is going to span 10 m.
