Terrace Width (in meters, i.e., FLOAT >= 0.0) - double the horizontal distance from the outer edge of the floodplain on one side of the river to the outer edge of the terrace on the same side of the river, making it terrace width. This value is the sum of horizontal terrace distances for both sizes of the river, so keep that in mind when designing your terraces. This applies symmetrically to both sides of the river.
