Critical dimensionless bed shear stress (tau*50) - This is an optional input. If you are going to specify a bankfull depth, then set this value to zero. If you want to use the classic equation to establish a bankfull depth to just yield the shear stress needed to mobilize the bed for a specified bed material grain size, then you can use this. Common values used for this parameter are 0.03, 0.045, 0.047, or 0.06, depending on what size fraction you want to insure would be mobilized at bankfull flow. The equation that uses this input is Eq. (4) in Brown et al. (2015).
