Three types of functions (Sine, Cosine, and SineSQ) provide periodic oscillations. As simple as those are individually, remember that you can add as many of them as you want into one overall function, using addition, subtraction, etc. As shown in Brown et al. (2014), it is possible to get some very interesting and meaningful variability patterns with 2-4 SIN() functions added together, using different values for frequency, amplitude, and phase. One way to ascertain what those parameter value could be would be to perform harmonic analysis on real series of river variables, such as bed elevation, width, meander centerline, etc. You can extract all the periodic functions you want from that kind of analysis and use those in your design to whatever degree you wish. Because rivers often do exhibit linear trends in variables, such as width and depth, we have added the linear function for use to create that effect. Sometimes you want to have a function that is deterministic and oscillating, but non-periodic. The best application for this type of function would be for the meander centerline, because channel alignment is not going to be truly periodic. To achieve this, we provide the Perlin noise function. To find out what sinuosity you get from a particular set of Perlin parameters, you have to run River Builder and look at the Data.csv file. That is a bit clunky, but it works.
