Bankfull Width Minimum (in meters, i.e., FLOAT >= 0.0) - the minimum distance between the bank tops on the X-Y plane. This variable is specified to protect the user from making a mistake with sub-reach variability functions in which the banks would cross over, yielding an impossible outcome. This insures that the river never has a zero or negative width. If you are confident in what you are doing, then you can set this to zero.
